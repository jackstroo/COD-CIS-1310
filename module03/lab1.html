            <h3>Why penguins are the <em>coolest</em> animal in the world:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>They can slide on their stomachs</li>
                <li>They can swim</li>
                <li>They eat fish</li>
                <li>They do all of this while being birds</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="images/penguin2.jpg" alt='"Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Brown Bluff, Tabarin Peninsula, Antarctic Peninsula", by Andrew Shiva, licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0'/>
            <p>This is a gentoo penguin, which I like because they have a <em>neat</em> name</p>
            <img src="images/penguin1.jpg" alt='"(Southern) Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome), Saunders Island, Falkland Islands", by Ben Tubby, licensed under CC BY 2.0'/>
            <p>This is a southern rockhopper penguin, one of my favorites because they look quite silly but also feisty</p>
            <p>This should give you an idea of how varied penguins can be, with there being a lot more species of them out there than just emperors.
